This is a web-based word game, essentially cloning the gameplay of Josh Wardle's [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/),
which itself is very similar to part of the television game show *Lingo*.

Unlike Wordle, this game picks random words every time you play, instead of presenting daily words.
